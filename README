Logship Toolchain
=====================

Introduction
------------

Logship is a simple application for retrieving logs from different
locations on multiple servers. It then stores them on a central host for
processing.

The module consists of three parts -
 * The configuration file that specifies which logs to ship from where
 * The script that does the retrieval
 * The cronjob that specifies when to fetch

We use puppet to aid in the deployment of logship and you'll find that
the files are organised as a puppet module - including a sample manifest.

Prerequisites
-------------

A user to run the ships. This should be present on the machine the logs
will be stored on. In the examples we use 'logship'

SSH passwordless connections for the rsyncs for the above user.

Using logship
-------------

While we use logship through puppet it's also possible to use it
standalone. Copy the logship script and cronjob in to place and then 
edit the config file to suit you location.

Configuration File Syntax
-------------------------

------------------------- example -------------------------

[example.com-live]
files = /var/log/apache2/example.com-access.log /var/log/apache2/example.com-error
hosts = liveweb01.example.com liveweb02.example.com liveweb03.example.com

-------------------------         -------------------------

Each config entry begins with a symbolic role name (this becomes the
subdirectory the logs are shipped to). It also contains a list of files to
ship and the hosts to retrieve them from.

Once this config entry has run you'll have a directory structure on the
machine logship is deployed to that looks like this:

$basedir/
    example.com-live/
        liveweb01.example.com_example.com-access.log
        liveweb01.example.com_example.com-error.log
        liveweb02.example.com_example.com-access.log
        liveweb02.example.com_example.com-error.log
        liveweb03.example.com_example.com-access.log
        liveweb03.example.com_example.com-error.log
Limitations
-----------

We only grab and keep the current log file. This will preclude any kind
of processing that requires history.
